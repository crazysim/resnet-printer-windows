# Resnet Printer Install Utility for Windows

This is the ResNet Printer Utility install script. The driver files and icon
are not included. This script is meant to be compiled to exe though it can be
run as-is for testing.

## Drivers

Use HP PARK to generate the dduout{32,64}.exe files from the non-bloatware
versions of the HP CP4025 drivers. Put them into the DriversTemp folder.

## Icons
Steal the icons from HP's distribution of drivers for OS X and convert them to
ICO format however you see fit.
